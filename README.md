## ecommerce_sentiment_analysis

This project is about exploring topic modelings and unsupervised machine learning by analyzing e-commerce clothings reviews.

## Introduction
In this project, I want to practice Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Unsupervised Machine Learning.

After some research on what dataset I could obtain from the web, I found a women clothings dataset of a real e-commerce business. 

## Project Design
The problem that I am trying to solve is to apply Natural Language Processiong (NLP) on reviews for Topic Modeling and “separation” of good and bad reviews using clustering.

Secondary goal is to perform a supervised learning problem with the Rating column from the dataset to classify good and bad reviews.
